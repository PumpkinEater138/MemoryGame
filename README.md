# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Israel Fernandez**

Time spent: **The time spent on glitch was 17 hours according to glitch.
But on my laptop, I leave most tabs open while I'm using my laptop. But the actual time
spent working on the actual project and research was about 6-7 hours. ** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [
  I had the game go at a faster pace from the begining all the way through the end.

  List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [
   I'm fairly new to web development, js, html, and css so getting familiar with new programming languages and web development was a bit challenging. But it wasn’t something I haven’t experienced.
   In the summer of 2021 I created an app for a research project using the programming language Swift. I also had some trouble adjusting but from what I’ve noticed, is that most programming languages
   look very similar to one another. So, getting comfortable with Swift, Js, Html, and css didn’t take long. While creating the memory game I attempted to
   add the optional features to it but I struggled. I added what I could, and I was successful with some features but I also failed on adding some of them. I was able to add more buttons,
   and change their color and tone. Additionally, I increased the speed of the clues. For me, was pretty simple since I just needed to change and add a few things to the code. I was also able
   to randomize the pattern everytime the program was started. I had some trouble figuring out how to do it but in the end I got the idea of assigning a random value from 1-8 to each individual
   array then later calling each array in the pattern along with it's randomized value and it worked. I tried adding the other optional features using past experiences and knowledge from other
   projects for example, in the app I created I had implemented a clock that kept track of the time rather than counting down. I took that same approach but tried adjusting it to count down every time
   the clue was done playing but unfortunately I wasn't successful. But I know that with the proper guidance and mentorship , I can get it done.When I was in high school,
   I hated mathematics because I was terrible at it. Now, I've taken three calculus courses along with two calculus based physics classes and now mathematics is my favorite subject because of how experienced and
   skilled I am with math. It's just a matter of learning and dedication.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [
   I would like to see the solutions for the optional features I missed. I'd also like to see the solutions to the features I managed to add just to see
   if there is a simpler approach than the approach I took of implementing the features. I also want to know if there's a way of designing the user interface without Html, or Css.
   When I was developing the app, I just used swift for the UI and all the functions. I've also heard that people have only used Html to create a website without Css or Js.
   Another question I have about web development is how does a developer choose the best appropriate approach to create all the logic of the web?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would take more time to research methods on how to implement the optional features. Aside from adding all the optional features,
   I would also add a mini jumpscare at any random moment. In my experience with horror games, it's always more suspenseful solving a puzzle while being chased. In the memory game there's
   no way to chase the user but a random jumpscare to increase the pressure of the game would go perfect. I’d also add a flickering screen that slightly causes the user to lose track of a random clue at a random level,
   but not completely. Just to the point where they can barely see the clue.
